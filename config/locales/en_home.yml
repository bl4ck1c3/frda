          The French Revolution Digital Archive (FRDA) is a multi-year collaboration of the Stanford University
          Libraries and the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) to produce a digital version of the key
          research sources of the French Revolution and make them available to the international scholarly
          community. The archive is based around two main resources, the Archives parlementaires and a vast
          corpus of images first brought together in 1989 and known as the Images de la Revolution française.

      about_text_ap_html: |
          The Archives parlementaires is a chronologically-ordered edited collection of sources on the French Revolution. 
          It was conceived in the mid 19th century as a project to produce a definitive record of parliamentary deliberations and also includes letters, 
          reports, speeches, and other first-hand accounts from a great variety of published and archival sources. Because of copyright limitations, 
          FRDA contains the AP volumes covering the years 1787-1794. The text of these volumes has been marked up using TEI so that speakers, 
          places, dates, and terms in the published index can be easily found.
      about_text_images_html: |
          The Images are composed of high-resolution digital images of approximately 12,000 individual visual items, primarily prints, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other 
          objects, which display aspects of the Revolution. These materials were selected from across the BnF’s departments,  and include thousands of images for the important collections
          entitled Hennin and De Vinck. Detailed metadata exists for the images, so that researchers can search by artist, subject, genre, and place.
