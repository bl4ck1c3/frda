        <p>The <em>French Revolution Digital Archive</em> (<em>FRDA</em>) is a multi-year collaboration of the
        Stanford University Libraries and the <em>Bibliothèque nationale de France</em> (BnF) to produce a digital
        version of the key research sources of the French Revolution and make them available to the international
        scholarly community. The archive is based around two main resources, the <em>Archives parlementaires </em>and
        a vast corpus of images first brought together in 1989 and known as the <em>Images de la Revolution française.
        </em></p>
      about_text_ap_html: |
        <p>The <em>Archives parlementaires</em> is a chronologically-ordered edited collection of sources on the
        French Revolution. It was conceived in the mid 19th century as a project to produce a definitive record of
        parliamentary deliberations and also includes letters, reports, speeches, and other first-hand accounts from a
        great variety of published and archival sources. Because of copyright limitations, <em>FRDA</em> contains the
        <em>AP</em> volumes covering the years 1787-1794. The text of these volumes has been marked up using TEI so
        that speakers, places, dates, and terms in the published index can be easily found. Users can see both scanned
        images of the <em>AP</em> pages or just the texts. </p>
      about_text_images_html: |
        <p>The <em>Images</em> are composed of high-resolution digital images of approximately 14&nbsp;000 individual
        visual items, primarily prints, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects, which display
        aspects of the Revolution. These materials were selected, mainly from the collections of the Département des
        Estampes et de la photographie, but also from other BnF departments, and include thousands of images for the
        important collections entitled Hennin and De Vinck. Detailed metadata exists for the images, so that
        researchers can search by artist, subject, genre, and place. </p>
