          The French Revolution Digital Archive (FRDA) is a multi-year collaboration of the Stanford University
          Libraries and the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) to produce a digital version of the key
          research sources of the French Revolution and make them available to the international scholarly
          community. The archive is based around two main resources, the Archives parlementaires and a vast
          corpus of images first brought together in 1989 and known as the Images de la Revolution française.

          The Archives parlementaires is a chronologically-ordered edited collection of sources on the French Revolution. 
          It was conceived in the mid 19th century as a project to produce a definitive record of parliamentary deliberations and also includes letters, 
          reports, speeches, and other first-hand accounts from a great variety of published and archival sources. Because of copyright limitations, 
          FRDA contains the AP volumes covering the years 1787-1794. The text of these volumes has been marked up using TEI so that speakers, 
          places, dates, and terms in the published index can be easily found.  While the AP started as a curatorial endeavor spearheaded by government 
          archivists, it later became a scholarly project under the direction of leading historians. This massive collection of historical sources was initiated 
          in 1862 at the request of the French legislature, and by 1914 had reached 82 volumes, each around 800 double-columned pages, covering the years 1789-1794. 
          After a long period of dormancy, the project was taken up again in 1962 by the Institut d’histoire de la Revolution française at the Université de Paris I; 
          its progress is ongoing. The current digital archive contains only the first 82 volumes from the first series of the Archives parlementaires, published before the Great War. 
          These volumes roughly cover the first five years of the French Revolution, from the Cahiers des états généraux of 1789 until 15 nivôse an II (4 January 1794). 
          They record the events ranging from the convening of the Estates General through the first half of the Terror.  The Archives parlementaires provide an unparalleled view
          into the workings of the Revolution through the thoughts and actions of its participants. The work is a day-to-day record of debates and discussions held by the three
          parliamentary bodies that legislated for France between 1789 and 1794. The first seven volumes of the AP present the Cahiers de doléances sent to the Estates General in 1789.
          Subsequent volumes draw primarily on official minutes of parliamentary debates, but also include journalistic accounts of the proceedings, speeches prepared for delivery
          but never presented, as well as letters, reports, and other documents received or reviewed by the assembly. Fragmented power, multiple authorities, and accounts from 
          various and conflicting perspectives further complicate the record. Given the Revolution’s rapid pace, the AP’s detailed and layered chronological organization of 
          Revolutionary sources provides an invaluable narrative to scholars. Over the decades, the AP has come to be accepted by scholars as the functional equivalent of primary 
          documentation, and it is virtually all scholars’ first recourse for research into the deliberative record of the Revolution through 1794.

          The Images are composed of high-resolution digital images of approximately 12,000 individual visual items, primarily prints, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other 
          objects, which display aspects of the Revolution. These materials were selected from across the BnF’s departments,  and include thousands of images for the important collections
          entitled Hennin and De Vinck. Detailed metadata exists for the images, so that researchers can search by artist, subject, genre, and place.  The FRDA provides access to the most
          complete searchable digital archive of French Revolution images available. Images de la Révolution française is a benchmark image-base undertaken by the Bibliothèque nationale 
          de France on the occasion of the Revolution’s bicentennial in 1989. It aimed to “allow the reader to explore the relationships, articulations and confrontations between the 
          ideas of the Revolution and their metaphorical embodiment, the constant cross-fertilization of ideology and make-believe…” For this project the BnF created over 38,000 separate 
          views of over 12,000 individual images, showing closeups and dividing documents with discrete iconographic materials into appropriate sections. Originally offered in analog format 
          on laserdisc, for over a decade the Images have been functionally inaccessible, the victim of rapid technological change. For the French Revolution Digital Archive about half of the
          original images were completely rescanned at high resolution. For the remaining images where rescanning was not an option, new JPEG files were created directly from the original 
          videodisk. Now all of these images are available online as part of the FRDA.  Over 12,000 image-based items, primarily prints from the Departement des Estampes et de la Photographie,
          but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects, were selected for inclusion from across the BnF’s departments. Many originally entered the BnF on legal deposit, but 
          others come from important collections acquired in the 19th and early 20th century. Two of these collections deserve special attention. The collection of Michel Hennin is notable 
          not only for its size, but because it includes many prints omitted from the legal deposit that Hennin amassed during his time in Italy working for the Viceroy, Prince Eugène de 
          Beauharnais. The print collection of Carl de Vinck, a Belgian diplomat, grew out of his father’s infatuation in Marie-Antoinette and expanded to focus more generally on visual 
          representations of France during the century from Marie-Antoinette’s marriage to Louis XVI in 1770 until the Paris Commune of 1870.  The images selected for the digital archive
          concentrate solely on the period from 1787 through 1799, from the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Revolution through the emergence of Napoleon. Only visual materials 
          directly tied to the Revolution itself are included. While the texts of the AP are primarily of interest to serious students and scholars of the Revolution, these images expand the FRDA’s
          audience to the general public. The creators of the initial incarnation of the Images anticipated that scholars would use them for their research and teaching purposes, and that the
          public at large would find in them an important way of learning more about this foundational moment for the French nation.
