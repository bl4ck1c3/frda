      <p>The French Revolution Digital Archive emerged from the expressed need by scholars of the French
      Revolution to gain greater and more flexible access to their sources. The French Revolution itself
      produced scores of documents by participants, spectators, and critics. These materials include texts of
      all sorts – legal documents, pamphlet literature, <em>belles lettres</em>, musical compositions, and a
      rich imagery. Dispersed in libraries and archives, hidden in documental series and in short individual
      pamphlets, this diverse documentary heritage can now be offered to scholars in a digital format. The
      French Revolution Digital Archive brings together two foundational sources for research: the
      <em>Archives parlementaires</em> (hereafter <em>AP</em>) and a vast collection of images selected from
      the collections of the <em>Bibliothèque nationale de France</em>. Both of these corpora were included
      in the important “French Revolution Research Collection” produced by the BnF and the Pergamon Press for
      the bicentennial of the Revolution in 1989. The <em>AP </em>appeared in microfilm format and the
      <em>Images</em> were offered on laserdisc.</p>
       <p>The <em>Archives parlementaires</em> is a chronologically-ordered edited collection of sources of
      archival and published source on the French Revolution It was conceived in the mid 19th century as a
      definitive record of parliamentary deliberations, with both intellectual and political aims, as
      described in the preface to the second edition: </p>
       <blockquote> What a most useful and brilliant school for the friends of liberty, whose numbers in
      Europe are increasing daily, what a most pleasant method of instruction for them, than a work in which
      they can collect all that our intellectuals, publicists, legislators, philosophers said and published
      to regenerate, develop, and complete a revolution whose happy influence has already made itself felt by
      all peoples! </blockquote>
       <p>While the <em>AP</em> started as a curatorial endeavor spearheaded by government archivists, it
      later became a scholarly project under the direction of leading historians. This massive collection of
      historical sources was initiated in 1862 at the request of the French legislature, and by 1914 had
      reached 82 volumes, each around 800 double-columned pages, covering the years 1789-1794. After a long
      period of dormancy, the project was taken up again in 1962 by the <em>Institut d’histoire de la
      Revolution française</em> at the Université de Paris I; its progress is ongoing. The current digital
      archive contains only the first 82 volumes from the first series of the <em>Archives
      parlementaires</em>, published before the Great War. These volumes roughly cover the first five years
      of the French Revolution, from the <em>Cahiers des états généraux</em> of 1789 until 15 nivôse an II (4
      January 1794). They record the events ranging from the convening of the Estates General through the
      first half of the Terror. </p>
       <p>The <em>Archives parlementaires</em> provide an unparalleled view into the workings of the
      Revolution through the thoughts and actions of its participants. The work is a day-to-day record of
      debates and discussions held by the three parliamentary bodies that legislated for France between 1789
      and 1794. The first seven volumes of the <em>AP</em> present the <em>Cahiers de doléances </em>sent to
      the Estates General in 1789. Subsequent volumes draw primarily on official minutes of parliamentary
      debates, but also include journalistic accounts of the proceedings, speeches prepared for delivery but
      never presented, as well as letters, reports, and other documents received or reviewed by the assembly.
      Fragmented power, multiple authorities, and accounts from various and conflicting perspectives further
      complicate the record. Given the Revolution’s rapid pace, the <em>AP</em>’s detailed and layered
      chronological organization of Revolutionary sources provides an invaluable narrative to scholars. Over
      the decades, the <em>AP</em> has come to be accepted by scholars as the functional equivalent of
      primary documentation, and it is virtually all scholars’ first recourse for research into the
      deliberative record of the Revolution through 1794. </p> <p>While the digitized version of the
      <em>AP</em> offers the most comprehensive way of accessing and analyzing the Revolution’s vast textual
      production, the French Revolution also produced a rich visual corpus of great importance. Because
      language was constantly exercised in new ways, because language <em>really</em> mattered to the
      Revolutionaries, and because events were unprecedented, the image-based record plays a significant role
      in helping researchers today understand the physical and intellectual universe of the Revolution. In
      effect, images of speakers, actors, debates and events help enormously to explain what surviving texts
      mean. Moreover, the visual material and iconography were a way for the revolutionaries to represent
      themselves and the Revolution while the events were taking place, and to spread their vision of the
      Revolution to the people of France and the world. </p>
       <p>The FRDA provides access to the most complete searchable digital archive of French Revolution
      images available. <em>Images de la Révolution française</em> is a benchmark image-base undertaken by
      the Bibliothèque nationale de France on the occasion of the Revolution’s bicentennial in 1989. It aimed
      to “allow the reader to explore the relationships, articulations and confrontations between the ideas
      of the Revolution and their metaphorical embodiment, the constant cross-fertilization of ideology and
      make-believe…” </a> For this project the BnF created over 38,000 separate views of over 14,000
      individual images, showing closeups and dividing documents with discrete iconographic materials into
      appropriate sections. The <em>Images, </em>which were originally offered in analog format on laserdisc,
      had become extremely difficult to access due to rapid technological change. Within the framework of its
      digitization programs, the BnF rescanned at high resolution almost half of the images on the laserdisc
      from the original materials. New JPEG files were created from the original videodisc for the remaining
      images in the corpus. Now all of these images are available online as part of the FRDA. </p>
       <p>Over 14,000 image-based items, primarily prints from the <em>Departement des Estampes et de la
      Photographie</em>, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects, were selected for
      inclusion from across the BnF’s departments. Many originally entered the BnF on legal deposit, but
      others come from important collections acquired in the 19th and early 20th century. Two of these
      collections deserve special attention. The collection of Michel Hennin is notable not only for its
      size, but because it includes many prints omitted from the legal deposit that Hennin amassed during his
      time in Italy working for the Viceroy, Prince Eugène de Beauharnais. The print collection of Carl de
      Vinck, a Belgian diplomat, grew out of his father’s infatuation in Marie-Antoinette and expanded to
      focus more generally on visual representations of France during the century from Marie-Antoinette’s
      marriage to Louis XVI in 1770 until the Paris Commune of 1870. </p>
       <p>The images selected for the digital archive concentrate solely on the period from 1787 through
      1799, from the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Revolution through the emergence of
      Napoleon. Only visual materials directly tied to the Revolution itself are included. While the texts of
      the AP are primarily of interest to serious students and scholars of the Revolution, these images
      expand the FRDA’s audience to the general public. The creators of the initial incarnation of the
      <em>Images</em> anticipated that scholars would use them for their research and teaching purposes, and
      that the public at large would find in them an important way of learning more about this foundational
      moment for the French nation. </p>
       <p>How does the French Revolution Digital Archive further scholars’ research through the digitized
      <em>Archives parlementaires </em>and the <em>Images</em>? The French Revolution was a messy and
      complicated event, and its documentary record reflects this. This project offers scholars new ways of
      using the old materials in their research by allowing them to search more effectively and efficiently
      across several years’ worth of key visual and written sources, using both free text and indexed
      searching. </p>
       <p>For the AP, personal names of speakers, dates, as well as the terms appearing in the AP’s published
      indexes have all been tagged in the text, allowing for more powerful searching capabilities. Search
      results are displayed so that scholars can more easily contextualize the use of selected terms and
      efficiently analyze the large body of texts. </p>
       <p>The images included in the FRDA are classified by provenance or by subject within the collections
      of the BnF. Descriptions of the Hennin and De Vinck image collections, which constitute an important
      part of the FRDA corpus, are found in separate print catalogues. The <em>Images de la Revolution
      francaise </em>laserdisc constituted an initial stage in the development of an iconographic corpus of
      the Revolution, bringing these visual materials together into a single collection accessible through
      highly indexed descriptive metadata using a controlled vocabulary for artists, iconographic genres,
      places of publications, and subject terms. Unfortunately the obsolescence of laserdisc technology meant
      the loss of access to this descriptive metadata, as well as to certain images themselves, which became
      available only through the General Catalog of the BnF. FRDA incorporates this indexed metadata, and
      expands its research possibilities, by finally restoring access to this coherent corpus of iconographic
      materials on the French Revolution. </p>
       <p>More importantly, scholars will be able to search each collection separately, and across both
      collections - the <em>Images</em> and the<em> Archives parlementaires</em>. By bringing the French
      Revolution’s textual and visual representations together virtually into a single curated collection
      with powerful means to search, analyze, and display the information, scholars and students will be able
      to advance our knowledge and understanding of this crucial period in world history. </p>
