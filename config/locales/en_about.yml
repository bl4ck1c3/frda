          The French Revolution Digital Archive emerged from the expressed need by
          scholars of the French Revolution to gain greater and more flexible access to their
          sources. The French Revolution itself produced scores of documents by participants,
          spectators, and critics. These materials include texts of all sorts – legal
          documents, pamphlet literature, belles lettres, musical compositions, and a rich
          imagery. Dispersed in libraries and archives, hidden in documental series and in
          short individual pamphlets, this diverse documentary heritage can now be offered to
          scholars in a digital format. The French Revolution Digital Archive brings together
          two foundational sources for research: the Archives parlementaires (hereafter AP)
          and a vast collection of images selected from the collections of the Bibliothèque
          nationale de France.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Archives parlementaires is a chronologically-ordered edited collection of sources
          of archival and published source on the French Revolution It was conceived in the
          mid 19th century as a definitive record of parliamentary deliberations, with both
          intellectual and political aims, as described in the preface to the second edition:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          What a most useful and brilliant school for the friends of
          liberty, whose numbers in Europe are increasing daily, what a most pleasant method
          of instruction for them, than a work in which they can collect all that our
          intellectuals, publicists, legislators, philosophers said and published to
          regenerate, develop, and complete a revolution whose happy influence has already
          made itself felt by all peoples!”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          While the AP started as a
          curatorial endeavor spearheaded by government archivists, it later became a
          scholarly project under the direction of leading historians. This massive
          collection of historical sources was initiated in 1862 at the request of the French
          legislature, and by 1914 had reached 82 volumes, each around 800 double-columned
          pages, covering the years 1789-1794. After a long period of dormancy, the project
          was taken up again in 1962 by the Institut d’histoire de la Revolution française at
          the Université de Paris I; its progress is ongoing. The current digital archive
          contains only the first 82 volumes from the first series of the Archives
          parlementaires, published before the Great War. These volumes roughly cover the
          first five years of the French Revolution, from the Cahiers des états généraux of
          1789 until 15 nivôse an II (4 January 1794). They record the events ranging from
          the convening of the Estates General through the first half of the Terror.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Archives parlementaires provide an unparalleled view into the workings of
          the Revolution through the thoughts and actions of its participants. The work is a
          day-to-day record of debates and discussions held by the three parliamentary bodies
          that legislated for France between 1789 and 1794. The first seven volumes of the AP
          present the Cahiers de doléances sent to the Estates General in 1789. Subsequent
          volumes draw primarily on official minutes of parliamentary debates, but also
          include journalistic accounts of the proceedings, speeches prepared for delivery
          but never presented, as well as letters, reports, and other documents received or
          reviewed by the assembly. Fragmented power, multiple authorities, and accounts from
          various and conflicting perspectives further complicate the record. Given the
          Revolution’s rapid pace, the AP’s detailed and layered chronological organization
          of Revolutionary sources provides an invaluable narrative to scholars. Over the
          decades, the AP has come to be accepted by scholars as the functional equivalent of
          primary documentation, and it is virtually all scholars’ first recourse for
          research into the deliberative record of the Revolution through 1794.
        </p>

          While the digitized version of the AP offers the most comprehensive way of accessing and
          analyzing the Revolution’s vast textual production, the French Revolution also
          produced a rich visual corpus of great importance. Because language was constantly
          exercised in new ways, because language really mattered to the Revolutionaries, and
          because events were unprecedented, the image-based record plays a significant role
          in helping researchers today understand the physical and intellectual universe of
          the Revolution. In effect, images of speakers, actors, debates and events help
          enormously to explain what surviving texts mean. Moreover, the visual material and
          iconography were a way for the revolutionaries to represent themselves and the
          Revolution while the events were taking place, and to spread their vision of the
          Revolution to the people of France and the world. </p> <p>The FRDA provides access
          to the most complete searchable digital archive of French Revolution images
          available. Images de la Révolution française is a benchmark image-base undertaken
          by the Bibliothèque nationale de France on the occasion of the Revolution’s
          bicentennial in 1989. It aimed to “allow the reader to explore the relationships,
          articulations and confrontations between the ideas of the Revolution and their
          metaphorical embodiment, the constant cross-fertilization of ideology and
          make-believe…” For this project the BnF created over 38,000 separate views of over
          12,000 individual images, showing closeups and dividing documents with discrete
          iconographic materials into appropriate sections. Originally offered in analog
          format on laserdisc, for over a decade the Images have been functionally
          inaccessible, the victim of rapid technological change. For the French Revolution
          Digital Archive about half of the original images were completely rescanned at high
          resolution. For the remaining images where rescanning was not an option, new JPEG
          files were created directly from the original videodisk. Now all of these images
          are available online as part of the FRDA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over 12,000 image-based items,
          primarily prints from the Departement des Estampes et de la Photographie, but also
          illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects, were selected for inclusion from
          across the BnF’s departments. Many originally entered the BnF on legal deposit, but
          others come from important collections acquired in the 19th and early 20th century.
          Two of these collections deserve special attention. The collection of Michel Hennin
          is notable not only for its size, but because it includes many prints omitted from
          the legal deposit that Hennin amassed during his time in Italy working for the
          Viceroy, Prince Eugène de Beauharnais. The print collection of Carl de Vinck, a
          Belgian diplomat, grew out of his father’s infatuation in Marie-Antoinette and
          expanded to focus more generally on visual representations of France during the
          century from Marie-Antoinette’s marriage to Louis XVI in 1770 until the Paris
          Commune of 1870.
        </p>
        <p>
          The images selected for the digital archive concentrate
          solely on the period from 1787 through 1799, from the years immediately preceding
          the outbreak of the Revolution through the emergence of Napoleon. Only visual
          materials directly tied to the Revolution itself are included. While the texts of
          the AP are primarily of interest to serious students and scholars of the
          Revolution, these images expand the FRDA’s audience to the general public. The
          creators of the initial incarnation of the Images anticipated that scholars would
          use them for their research and teaching purposes, and that the public at large
          would find in them an important way of learning more about this foundational moment
          for the French nation. </p> <p>How does the French Revolution Digital Archive
          further scholars’ research through the digitized Archives parlementaires and the
          Images? The French Revolution was a messy and complicated event, and its
          documentary record reflects this. This project offers scholars new ways of using
          the old materials in their research by allowing them to search more effectively and
          efficiently across several years’ worth of key visual and written sources, using
          both free text and indexed searching.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the AP, personal names of
          speakers, dates, as well as the terms appearing in the AP’s published indexes have
          all been tagged in the text, allowing for more powerful searching capabilities.
          Search results are displayed so that scholars can more easily contextualize the use
          of selected terms and efficiently analyze the large body of texts. </p> <p>Prior to
          the development of the Images digital collection, the images of FRDA were
          classified and described in disparate specialized catalogs which separated the
          images by provenance rather than grouping them by subject. The 1989 Images project
          brought these visual materials together into a single catalog and created highly
          indexed descriptive metadata using a controlled vocabulary for artists,
          iconographic genres, places of publication, and subject terms. In their new
          incarnation as part of the FRDA, the digital format allows scholars to harness the
          intellectual power of this specialized metadata to search through the entire corpus
          of images.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, scholars will be able to search each
          collection separately, and across both collections - the Images and the Archives
          parlementaires. By bringing the French Revolution’s textual and visual
          representations together virtually into a single curated collection with powerful
          means to search, analyze, and display the information, scholars and students will
          be able to advance our knowledge and understanding of this crucial period in world
          history.
